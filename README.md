# Seamless_Cloning

This project implements seamless cloning using poisson image Editing as described by Perez et al. (2003) (https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall07/Papers/Perez03.pdf)
We contrast this with Shepard's interpolation as an alternative to the laplace membrane, as described by Farbman et al. (2011)
